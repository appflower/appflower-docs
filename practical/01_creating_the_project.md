# Building a CRM Application in 60 Minutes

In this book we'll build a CRM (Customer Relations Management) application using AppFlower technology. Such a software might have various features to manage customer related issues, such as contacts, communications, sales or even technical support. CRM solutions can (among other things) greatly improve your company's efficiency, but are usually not cheap to buy and even more expensive to develop. To mention a few well-known CRM's on the market, there exists <a href="http://crm.dynamics.com">Microsoft Dynamics</a>, <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com">SugarCRM<a>, <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/crm">SalesForce</a> and <a href="http://www.sap.com/crm">SAP</a>

However, with AppFlower your options are different: you can not only develop such a tool yourself (eliminating the need of paying those high prices), but you can do this very quickly! Of course, CRM solutions differ greatly in features and complexity. The one we are going to build is a somewhat simpler, yet fully functional solution, suitable for managing all basic CRM needs: will track your clients, contact persons, deals and sales activities. Best of all, this software will be easily extensible too: once you've created it, you'll be able to add new features and make it twice as powerful in just another couple of hours. 

## The CRM Tutorial
This tutorial has been split into 10 short chapters, each describing how to accomplish building an important component of our CRM application. This guide does not require you to have any previous experience with AppFlower and we will try to explain what is needed as we progress with creating the application. Sometimes you will be suggested to read up on external links, but this is fully up to you.


## Before You Begin
We assume you already have installed AppFlower Studio or have access to an instance installed somewhere else.  For the best results, we suggest you to install our <a href="http://www.appflower.com/doc/1_1/learn_install">virtual machine</a>, as this is the fastest and most fail-safe way to get started.  

NOTICE: So when you have AppFlower Studio installed, and can access it with your browser you are ready go!
