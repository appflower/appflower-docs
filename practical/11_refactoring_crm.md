# Refactoring with what you have Learned
You have now learned enough to make a fully working CRM application. Let's take the pieces you have learned so far, and apply them to all places in the app. So the app becomes consistent and complete. So let's repeat some of the steps and apply them to the entire app.

1. ***Widget Title*** we learned in the Account List chapter to change the Title of a Widget. By doing so we can make the widgets have more informative titles. This can be changed for all edit and title widgets.

2. ***List Actions, Sorting & Filters*** as you learned for the Opportunity List, the default sorting and filtering doesn't apply for multiple pages. And we could improve usability by adding actions to rows. To ease the process of editing and deleting entries in the list. You could revisit your List widgets and change this behavior to work with multiple pages, and add proper actions for each list view.

<div class="image_medium" style="float:right;"><a href="/uploads/book/praticalcrm/refactor5.png" rel="prettyPhoto" title=""><img alt="Buttons and comments" src="/uploads/book/praticalcrm/refactor5.png" hspace="5" vspace="5"></a></div>

3. ***Form Buttons and Fields Comments*** we could add buttons to all Forms to make navigation more smooth. And to ease usability by adding field comments. Let's do so.



<div class="image_medium" style="float:right;"><a href="/uploads/book/praticalcrm/refactor4.png" rel="prettyPhoto" title=""><img alt="Validators" src="/uploads/book/praticalcrm/refactor4.png" hspace="5" vspace="5"></a></div>

4. ***Validators*** we learned to make field validators, and we should apply these to all fields; for those we believe is mandatory, and requires input validation. You can go through the Edit Widgets of Account, Contact, Opportunity and Activity to make sure they all have validators set.



NOTICE: Don't worry if you get stuck in any of the points or wonder how we made it. This is just a small exercise. Your app is already working. And you will be able see how we did it, through the CRM video tutorial. Or by downloading and importing the entire app, which we will explain in the next serie of Practical AppFlower.
