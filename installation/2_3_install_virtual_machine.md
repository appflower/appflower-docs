# AppFlower Virtual Machine installation
The easiest and fastest way to install is the "virtual machine". This is a pre-configured AppFlower package with operating system and the necessary applications installed (like Apache, MySQL, PHP with APC and more). You don't need to mess with various settings to get started, it is ready to use out of the box.

NOTE: The virtual machine which includes AppFlower Engine and Studio also includes a sample project with full source code.

# Getting and Installing AppFlower
 1. ***<a href="http://cdn.appflower.com/vmware.zip">Download</a>*** the appflower virtual machine image. It is a compressed file (zip) for faster download.

 2. Once you got it, unzip it anywhere on your computer. It contains a single file called AppFlower.vmdk

NOTE: If you don't have an unzip application installed, you can download either  <a href="http://www.winzip.com">Winzip</a> (for Windows or Mac) or <a href="http://www.stuffit.com/mac-expander.html">StuffIt</a> (for Mac)

 3. In order to use this package, you'll need a virtualization solution. We recommend VirtualBox, since it's free, but AppFlower runs smoothly with VmWare as well. This guide will focus on getting it running on top of <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>

NOTE: A virtualization solution is a software that allows you to run other operating systems using your current OS. So for instance, if you are on Windows, you could run Linux right from your desktop and vice-versa. This is accomplished using a so called "virtual machine" that acts like a real computer: You can turn it on, work with it, then turn it off. This way you can have several systems as virtual computers (like Linux, or maybe another version of Windows), and you can use them whenever you need them without restarting your computer. The AppFlower virtual machine works with several such solutions for Mac, Windows and Linux: VirtualBox, VmWare Workstation, VMWare Fusion and Parallels Desktop are all supported.
