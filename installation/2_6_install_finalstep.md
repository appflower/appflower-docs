# Finalizing Installation
Now that you have installed and started the virtual machine, itâ€™s time to take the last step.

<div class="image_medium" style="float:right;"><a href="/uploads/book/virtualmachine/ip.PNG" rel="prettyPhoto" title="The IP address is displayed on this screen"><img alt="Getting the IP Address" src="/uploads/book/virtualmachine/ip.PNG" hspace="5" vspace="5"></a></div>

1. All you have to do is to click to the _virtual machine window_. Check out the URL displayed there, this is what you have to open in your browser to access the newly created project. It looks something like this:

http://192.168.10.1

The actual number displayed varies from system to system according to your network settings.

2. Open up this URL in your browser now.

That's it! Now you should see a web page with links to the Playground and SeedControl Projects.
