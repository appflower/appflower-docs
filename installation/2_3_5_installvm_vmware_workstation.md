# Installing AppFlower with VMWare Workstation
VMWare Workstation is another way to get AppFlower running easily. If you don't have it already, you may download Workstation from the
<a href="https://www.vmware.com/tryvmware/?p=workstation&lp=1" >VMWare Workstation download page</a>. Should you have difficulties installing it (you shouldn't, it's easy -:), please consult the
<a href="http://www.vmware.com/pdf/ws71_manual.pdf" >User Manual</a>.


Once you got the application installed, please have a look at this ***video tutorial***. It will explain how to configure Workstation properly to run AppFlower. All the instructions are also outlined below as text.

NOTE: Please note that currently only ***Workstation***. We have not tested this on any other VMware products like Player.

# Configuring VMWare Workstation

 1. If you don't have it already, <a href="http://cdn.appflower.com/vmware.zip">download</a> the AppFlower package from us and unpack it somewhere (any directory will do).

 2. Locate the AppFlower.vmdk file you've unpacked.

 3. Start ***Workstation*** and create a ***new virtual machine***, with the following settings:

- Use existing virtual disk and point it to your unpacked AppFlower.vmdk file.

- Use Linux as ***operating system***, and the ***version*** Other Linux 2.6.x kernel.

- Finish the wizard and wait for the installation to complete.


4. Finally, ***start up*** (double click) the newly created virtual machine. 

That's it! The virtual machine is now booting, and the AppFlower system will show up in a few minutes.
