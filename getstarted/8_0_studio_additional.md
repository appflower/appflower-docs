# Additional Studio Tools

Besides its integrated code editors, widget and layout designers and model editor, Studio provides some more useful development tools for you. 


These are not essential to develop AppFlower applications, but will come in handy in many situations, since they allow you perform tasks that normally you would have to do using third-party software, ***directly from Studio***.
This saves you time and makes development faster and smoother.

Currently Studio offers the following extra tools:

The Console is able to execute various system commands and external programs, much like the _shell of your OS_. It is very useful for background operations, such as working with ***Symfony tasks*** or other ***PHP CLI*** applications, and executing system utilities to perform system level adjustments, administrative tasks etc. 

It is not a shell replacement, but has enough power to perform the most important operations.


The Database Query Tool lets you take good care of your database. You can _browse_ the contents of any table as well as perform all the necessary database operations, such as _adding, updating or deleting records_ and several other things.

The tool supports any valid ***MySQL*** query and alternatively provides ***Propel 1.5*** support too, so you can perform tasks via PHP as well.

The Notification and Debug System is group of tools that allow you to easily track down ***coding and user-made*** errors. These help you to detect all problems efficiently, by providing access to various important _system logs_, doing automatic _audit logging_ and notifying you about important events or possible issues.

So, let's have a look at these components one by one! We'll start with the Console widget.
