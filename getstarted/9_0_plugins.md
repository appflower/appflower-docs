# About Plug-ins
A plug-in is a way to easily extend the functionality of a given application. It is a small package that "attaches" to the application and thereby adds new features to it. Plug-ins can be installed or uninstalled any time. Furthermore, they're are usually relatively easy to add or remove, so users of the application can do this on their own, no special knowledge is required.
