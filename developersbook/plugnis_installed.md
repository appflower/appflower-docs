# Available Plug-ins
Here comes a summary of those plug-ins available in all projects created with Studio. Many of them are used by Studio, but they can be useful for your application as well. 

The descriptions below don't include all the details or usage instructions, because their primary purpose is to give you a basic overview. Furthermore, AppFlower already integrated these plug-ins, so most users won't have to mess with them at all. 

However, if you need more details, you can always check either the web page of the plug-in (listed beneath the description) or the included readme file.


Additional (free) plug-ins are available here:

# Installed AppFlower Plug-ins

afGuardPlugin (also known as afAuthentication) adds secure (password protected) user accounts and authentication tools to your AppFlower application. It allows you to create and manage as many different users as you like, each with different access levels and their own secure password. It is based on the similarly named Symfony plug-in, sfGuard.
