# Working with AppFlower Plugins
AppFlower comes with a few pre-installed plug-ins. Some of these are specific to AppFlower, their names start with af, others are general purpose Symfony plug-ins, their names start with  sf. Technically speaking, all of them are Symfony plug-ins, since that's the foundation AppFlower is based on, but some can be used only with AppFlower applications, therefore it's more accurate to call those AppFlower plug-ins. 

The purpose of this chapter is to give you an overview of all of these as well as to show you how to add, remove and create plug-ins.
